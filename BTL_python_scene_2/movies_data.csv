Đừng Quá Nhiệt Tình,Larry David,"In 2003, a man named Juan Catalan was arrested for murder in Los Angeles. He repeatedly professed his innocence, and asked to take a polygraph test, a request that the police denied (note: polygraph tests aren't admissible in court). He also had an alibi. He swore that at the time of the murder, he was at Dodger Stadium with his little girl, watching the Dodgers vs. the Braves, but his lawyer was unable to find him in any of the Dodger Vision or FOX footage he subpoenaed. However, he discovered that there was another source of crowd footage: Curb Your Enthusiasm season four, episode six, The Car Pool Lane (2004) had filmed at Dodger Stadium that night. Although Catalan did not make the final cut of the show, his lawyer was finally able to find him and his daughter in the outtakes, and determined from the timestamps on the tapes that Catalan could not have been the killer. When told that his show had released a wrongfully accused man from prison and a trial that could have led to the death penalty, Larry David commented, ""I tell people that I've now done one decent thing in my life, albeit inadvertently.""

Kỵ Sĩ Bóng Đêm Trỗi Dậy,Christopher Nolan,"About a year before this movie's release, writer, producer, and director Sir Christopher Nolan mentioned he was considering using a mixture of CGI and deleted scenes from Kỵ Sĩ Bóng Đêm (2008) to have the Joker appear briefly, which Bryan Singer had done to bring back Marlon Brando as Jor-El in Siêu Nhân Trở Lại (2006). Nolan ultimately decided it was disrespectful to Heath Ledger.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4ODQzNDY3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODA0NTM4Nw@@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg"
Những Người Khốn Khổ,Tom Hooper,"Fantine's assault by a rejected customer is based on an actual incident from Victor Hugo's life that resulted in Fantine's creation: he was on his way to his editor's office when he encountered a young man harassing a prostitute. When she rejected his advances, he shoved a handful of snow down her dress and shoved her to the ground. When she defended herself with her fists, he immediately called the police to arrest his ""assailant"". Hugo was a minor celebrity at the time, and spoke up on the woman's behalf when the police arrived, and was able to have her set free. Hugo said he was horrified by the unfairness of the woman's situation, and began to imagine that she might have children depending on her, and thus Fantine appeared in his mind.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Q1YjIxZTAtZTU0YS00ZmE5LWEwODEtY2IyYWM2ZTJlOWE1XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg"

Blonde,Andrew Dominik,"This film is based on the 2000 novel ""Blonde"" by Joyce Carol Oates, which is a fictionalized account inspired by the life of Marilyn Monroe, not an actual biography. Oates insisted that the novel is a work of fiction that should not be regarded as a biography. Oates said that she didn't have anything to do with the making of this film, though once in a while, director Andrew Dominik would get in contact with her, and that she was given an almost-final cut in 2020 and she has praised the film ever since. The novel had been previously adapted into a two-part miniseries: Blonde (2001), starring Poppy Montgomery as Monroe.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDllNjNhMWYtZTg0ZC00ZTE3LWI3MDgtMThiOTY0NTBmOGI4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX190_CR0,0,190,281_.jpg"
